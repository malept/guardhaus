## Filing Pull Requests

Here are some things to keep in mind as you file a pull request to fix a bug, add a new feature,
etc.:

* GitHub Actions are used to make sure that the project builds as expected on the supported platforms, using the current stable version of Rust.
  Make sure the testsuite passes locally by running `cargo test`.
* Unless it's impractical, please write tests for your changes. This will help spot regressions
  much easier.
* If your PR changes the behavior of an existing feature, or adds a new feature, please add/edit
  the `rustdoc` inline documentation.
* Please ensure that your changes follow the [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt)
  coding standard, and do not produce any warnings when running the
  [clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy) linter.
* If you are contributing a nontrivial change, please add an entry to `NEWS.md`. The format is
  similar to the one described at [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).
* Please **do not** bump the version number in your pull requests, the maintainers will do that.
  Feel free to indicate whether the changes require a major, minor, or patch version bump, as
  prescribed by the [semantic versioning specification](http://semver.org/).
* Please make sure your commits are rebased onto the latest commit in the main branch, and that
  you limit/squash the number of commits created to a "feature"-level. For instance:

bad:

```
commit 1: add foo
commit 2: run rustfmt
commit 3: add test
commit 4: add docs
commit 5: add bar
commit 6: add test + docs
```

good:

```
commit 1: add foo
commit 2: add bar
```

If you are continuing the work of another person's PR and need to rebase/squash, please retain the
attribution of the original author(s) and continue the work in subsequent commits.
